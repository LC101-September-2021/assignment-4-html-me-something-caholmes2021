         <p>
            Tokyo Ghoul would be classified as a horror anime and is not for 
            the faint of heart. This series takes place in Tokyo where humans and ghouls
            must coexist together - even though the relationship between the two is more 
            of predator and prey. We are introduced to the main character, Kaneki Ken, and follow his 
            life as he transitions into the &quot;one-eyed ghoul&quot;!
